This project was created to fill Free Code Camp's 2017 Back-End Server Certification. It utilizes Yelp's API to bring up search results for any city in its database, showing the bars for each city. Users can RSVP to see real-time results of who is attending.

Please note that as this is currently hosted on Heroku's free service, it can take up to 30 seconds to load the page. Thanks.
